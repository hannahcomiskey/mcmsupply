get_national_modelinputs(
  local = FALSE,
  mycountry = NULL,
  startyear = 1990,
  endyear = 2030.5,
  nsegments = 12,
  raw_data
)
}
\arguments{
\item{local}{TRUE/FALSE. Default is FALSE. local=FALSE retrieves the data for all subnational provinces across all countries. local=TRUE retrieves data for only one country.}

\item{mycountry}{The country name of interest in a local run. You must have local=TRUE for this functionality. A list of possible countries available found in data/mycountries.rda.}

\item{startyear}{The year you wish to begin your predictions from. Default is 1990.}

\item{endyear}{The year you wish to finish your predictions. Default is 2030.5.}

\item{nsegments}{The number of knots you wish to use in your basis functions. Default is 12.}

\item{raw_data}{The national family planning source data from the 'get_subnational_data' function.}
}
\value{
A list of modelling inputs for the JAGS model.
\enumerate{
\item Tstar is the year index for the most recent survey in each province.
\item Kstar is the knot index that aligns with Tstar.
\item B.ik are the basis functions.
\item n_years are total number of years
\item n_obs  are the total number of observations
\item K are the number of knots.
\item H is K-1. Used in the calculation of first order differences of spline coefficients.
\item M_count is the number of modern contraceptive methods.
\item matchcountry is the country indexing to match the observed data to the predictions.
\item matchmethod is the method indexing to match the observed data to the predictions.
\item matchyears is the year indexing to match the observed data to the predictions.
