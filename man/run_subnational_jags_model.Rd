\arguments{
\item{jagsdata}{The inputs for the JAGS model}

\item{jagsparams}{The parameters of the JAGS model you wish to review}

\item{local}{TRUE/FALSE. Default is FALSE. local=FALSE retrieves the data for all subnational provinces across all countries. local=TRUE retrieves data for only one country.}

\item{spatial}{TRUE/FALSE. Default is FALSE. spatial=FALSE retrieves the data for all subnational provinces across all countries without GPS information. spatial=TRUE retrieves for data for countries with GPS information as well as FP source data.}

\item{main_path}{Default is "results/". String to indicate where to save results.}

\item{n_iter}{Default is 80000. Number of itterations to do in JAGS model.}

\item{n_burnin}{Default is 10000. Number of samples to burn-in in JAGS model.}

\item{n_thin}{Default is 35. Number of samples to thin by in JAGS model.}

\item{mycountry}{The country name of interest in a local run. You must have local=TRUE for this functionality. A list of possible countries available found in data/mycountries.rda.}
