Dear Professor Cook,
\bigskip

Please consider our article titled "mcmsupply: An R package for estimating public and private sector contraceptive market supply shares" for publication in the R Journal.

The manuscript introduces the new package called `mcmsupply` which enables users to estimate and project modern contraceptive supply-shares at the national and sub-national administration levels for low- and middle-income countries using either Demographic and Health Survey data or custom user-supplied data. It is the first of its kind to produce annual contraceptive method supply share estimates with uncertainty. This package enables users to use a Bayesian framework to produce method supply-share estimates for countries across the world.

We believe the readers of the R Journal will enjoy and find this article helpful, as it is novel in its subject matter while remaining accessible to subject non-experts. We consider the utilisation of both multi-country and single country datasets, and provide an accessible and well-documented modelling framework for both. Our approach incorporates both cross-method correlations and complex hierarchical structures to take advantage of the geographic nature of the data and overcome issues associated with data-sparsity, while using flexible penalised-splines capture the complex shape of the data.
