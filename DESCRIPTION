Description: Family Planning programs and initiatives typically use nationally 
    representative surveys to estimate key indicators of a countryâ€™s family 
    planning progress. However, in recent years, routinely collected family 
    planning services data (Service Statistics) have been used as a 
    supplementary data source to bridge gaps in the surveys. The use of service 
    statistics comes with the caveat that adjustments need to be made for 
    missing private sector contributions to the contraceptive method supply 
    chain. Evaluating the supply source of modern contraceptives often relies 
    on Demographic Health Surveys (DHS), where many countries do not have 
    recent data beyond 2015/16. Fortunately, in the absence of recent surveys 
    we can rely on statistical model-based estimates and projections to fill 
    the knowledge gap. We present a Bayesian, hierarchical, penalized-spline 
    model with multivariate-normal spline coefficients, to account for across 
    method correlations, to produce country-specific, annual estimates for the 
    proportion of modern contraceptive methods coming from the public and 
    private sectors. This package provides a quick and convenient way for users 
    to access the DHS modern contraceptive supply share data at national and 
    subnational administration levels, estimate, evaluate and plot annual 
    estimates with uncertainty for a sample of low- and middle-income countries.
